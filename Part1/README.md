# GuitarCollection-Part1

Welcome to the `GuitarCollection-Part1` repository. This repository contains an example solution for Part 1 of the COSC 2436 Data Structures and Algorithms final project, implemented using pseudocode.

The solution in this repository demonstrates how to define an object class for a guitar collection catalog system, with attributes such as model, brand, year, and type. It also includes an initial design document, outlining the data structures and algorithms that will be used for managing the guitar collection.

## Note to Students

While this example solution is written in pseudocode for simplicity and to provide a high-level understanding of the problem, actual submissions should be implemented using a programming language. Specifically, you should write your code in one of the following languages:

- C++
- Java
- Python

Please refer to the assignment instructions for more details about the requirements, and make sure to follow best coding practices, such as proper indentation, naming conventions, and including comments in your code.

Good luck with your project!
