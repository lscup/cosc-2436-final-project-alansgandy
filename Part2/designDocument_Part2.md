# Initial Design Document (Part 2 update):

**Title:** Guitar Collection Catalog System  
**Student:** Suzy Student  
**Course:** COSC 2436 Fall 23  

# Project Progress:

## Data Structures:

In Part 2 of the project, we've implemented two different data structures to manage our guitar collection. We've chosen to use an ArrayList to store the collection and a HashMap for fast searching of guitars by the model attribute.

## Search Algorithms:

We've also implemented two different search algorithms.

- **HashMap Retrieval:** One is a simple retrieval from the HashMap to search for a guitar by its model.
- **Linear Search:** The other is a linear search through the ArrayList to search for a guitar by any attribute.

## Sorting Algorithm:

We've implemented the Quick Sort algorithm to sort our guitar collection by any attribute. We chose Quick Sort because it has an average time complexity of O(n log n), and it is one of the most efficient sorting algorithms, especially for large datasets.
