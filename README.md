# BooksCollection-Project-Example

Welcome to the `GuitarCollection-Project-Example` repository. This repository contains example solutions for the COSC 2436 Data Structures and Algorithms final project, implemented using pseudocode.

This project is designed to demonstrate the application of fundamental data structures and search algorithms in a program used to catalog a collection of objects, in this case, guitars.

## Repository Structure

This repository is divided into three main parts, each represented by a corresponding directory:

- `Part1`: This directory contains the pseudocode and the design document for the first part of the project, focusing on the object definition. You will find a file named `guitar.txt` containing pseudocode for the guitar object definition and a markdown file `designDocument_Part1.md` describing the design decisions.

- `Part2`: This directory contains the pseudocode and the design document for the second part of the project, which covers the use of data structures and search algorithms. The file `guitarMethods.txt` contains the pseudocode implementing these concepts, and `designDocument_Part2.md` explains the related design decisions.

- `Part3`: This directory contains the pseudocode, user manual and the design document for the third part of the project. You'll find the pseudocode in the `userInterface.txt` file, the corresponding design decisions in the `designDocument_Part3.md` file and the user guide in `userManual.md`.

## Note to Students

While these example solutions are written in pseudocode for simplicity and to provide a high-level understanding of the problem, actual submissions should be implemented using a programming language. Specifically, you should write your code in one of the following languages:

- C++
- Java
- Python

Please refer to the assignment instructions for more details about the requirements, and make sure to follow best coding practices, such as proper indentation, naming conventions, and including comments in your code.

Good luck with your project!
